As the game starts there is a 10 seconds window for all th e clients to connect to the server
For the question "Do you want to be the leader" the answer is case sensitive and should be "yes" or "no". If multiple yes are received then the server selects a leader at random out of those who replied yes. Atleast one person has to reply yes for this question.
Whenever a question pops asking to write answer or PASS, PASS should be in all caps.
Game switches between two levels 1 & 2, i.e. Novice and Expert.
For the second level the number of contacts must be greater than or equal to half of the number of players.
